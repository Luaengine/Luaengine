The is a 2d and 3d graphics and physics engine written in Lua,
I could only have done this thanks to a compiler written in C,
it's called Scrupp and was written by Andreas Krinke.
http://scrupp.sourceforge.net/index.html

This engine piggy-backs off OpenGL a C graphics engine,
and thanks to this execution time is fast and smooth.

I hope for this engine to be a hub of user-created content,
as this engine is built around running modules.

For an in-depth command list look in documentation.txt
